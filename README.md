Generally speaking, the defination opf Co-Working is when people assemble in a neutral space to work independently on different projects, or in groups on the
same projects.
This website deals with providing Co-Working spaces to Tech workers. It also provides meeting halls, projector,etc. It's different than a typical office workspace
because the people in a coworking environment generally aren't working for the same company.
Co-Working space provides amenities you would find in traditionaal office. A major differentiator is flexibility since you don't need to sign a long-term lease in 
coworking space.
